examples demonstrates how gradient descent work in linear regression, beacon location ...

## linear regression  
data.csv is a 2 params linear regression data, download from https://github.com/mattnedrich/GradientDescentExample


## beacon location
beacon.csv is beacon location data, data format is as below:

    col 1: x of beacon n; 
    col 2: y of beacon n; 
    col 3: measured distance between current pose and neacon n

## find_minimum of a curve
find_minimum_2d.py

## find_minimum of a surface
find_minimum_3d.py
try to adjust start [x,y], find how start point affect the result(easily converge to local optimum)
